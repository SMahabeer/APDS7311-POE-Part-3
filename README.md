## Bcrypt.js
> [!NOTE]
> Information on Bcrypt.js.

Bcrypt.js is an useful Node.js package for password hashing. It uses the bcrypt password hashing technique, which is regarded as a safe and industry-standard approach for storing passwords in a database (Khaled, 2024).


## Cookie parser
> [!NOTE]
> Information on Cookie-parser.

Cookie-parser is middleware that makes it easier to handle cookies. It parses incoming cookies from client requests and stores them in the request.cookies object. This allows you to read and manipulate cookies in your Express JS application without having to parse them manually (geeksforgeeks, 2024).


## Crypto
> [!NOTE]
> Information on Crypto.

Crypto is a Node.js module that implements an algorithm for data encryption and decryption. This is used for security purposes, such as user authentication, by keeping the password in encrypted form in a database (Pabbly, 2024).


## Csurf
> [!NOTE]
> Information on Csurf.

Csurf middleware in Node.js protects against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks on an application. When a browser loads a page from the server, this module delivers a randomly generated string as a CSRF token. As a result, the POST request will deliver the random CSRF token as a cookie. Because tokens are produced at random, the one delivered for each request will be unique (geeksforgeeks, 2024).


## Dotenv
> [!NOTE]
> Information on Dotenv.

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that imports environment variables from a.env file into process.env. The Twelve-Factor App technique dictates that configuration be stored separately from code within the environment (Npm, 2024).


## Express Session
> [!NOTE]
> Information on Express Session.

The express-session module allows you to manage sessions in node.js. It aids in storing data in the key-value format. This module just saves the session ID in the cookie, not the session data (geeksforgeeks, 2024).


## Express Validator
> [!NOTE]
> Information on Express Validator.

Express-Validator is a middleware package that combines the Express JS module with the Validator.js module, which includes validators and sanitizers for string data types. Express-Validator offers the ability to validate input data via a validation chain (Singh, 2024).


## Express
> [!NOTE]
> Information on Express.

Express is a Node.js web application framework that offers a wide range of functionality for developing online and mobile apps. It is used to create single, multipage, and hybrid web applications. It's a layer that sits on top of Node.js and helps manage servers and routes (Sharma, 2024).


## Helmet
> [!NOTE]
> Information on Helmet.

Helmet is a group of Node.js middleware modules that safeguard web applications by setting critical HTTP headers. These headers are critical in preventing common online vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Clickjacking, and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Helmet serves as your application's protective armour, delivering critical levels of protection without the need for complicated setups (Jacob, 2023).


## Mongoose
> [!NOTE]
> Information on Mongoose.

Mongoose is an ODM library for MongoDB and Node.js. It handles data associations, does schema validation, and bridges the gap between coded objects and their MongoDB representations (freeCodeCamp, 2018).
